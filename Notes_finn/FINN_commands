NHWC:
	N: Number of images in the batch (also referred to as the batch size).
	H: Height of the image or feature map.
	W: Width of the image or feature map.
	C: Number of channels (such as RGB channels in images, or feature channels in a convolutional layer).

	get_test_model with pretrained=True
	wbits - weight bits, abits - activation bits
	
finn.transformation.streamline.reorder.MoveScalarLinearPastInvariants
	Move scalar linear operations (mul, add) past functions which are invariant to them. Specifically, matches and transforms the following patterns: f(x*C) -> f(x) * C f(x+C) -> f(x) + C where x is a dynamic input, C is a constant tensor. Known f which obey this property are: Reshape, Flatten, Transpose, GlobalAveragePool

qonnx.transformation.lower_convs_to_matmul.LowerConvsToMatMul
	Replace Conv layers with pairs of Im2Col-MatMul layers, plus Transpose layers to keep the original data layout.

classfinn.transformation.streamline.Streamline
	Apply the streamlining transform, see arXiv:1709.04060.
	
	
finn.transformation.streamline.absorb.AbsorbTransposeIntoMultiThreshold
	For (NCHWTranspose -> MultiThreshold) move Transpose past MultiThreshold and set its data_layout mode to NHWC.
	

finn.transformation.streamline.reorder.MakeMaxPoolNHWC
	Convert (MaxPool, NHWCTranspose) into (NHWCTranspose, MaxPoolNHWC) and (NCHWTranspose, MaxPool) into (MaxPoolNHWC, NCHWTranspose).
